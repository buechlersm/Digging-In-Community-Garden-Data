# Ingestion

New data will be incorporated into the Digging In repository through a mediated process between a Digging In curator and data publishers. Initial data files should be submitted to Digging In in as complete a format as possible. Upon receipt Digging In will assign a unique identifier to your dataset, note any necessary changes to comply with Digging In standards, and contact the designated parties with next steps and their implications for data sharing. After data has been tidied and documented to repository standards through this iterative process, datasets will published and become publicly accessible for future use.
