# User Community

There are a number of potential users of our protocol. Policy-makers, researchers, and advocates, both at the state and local levels are the primary audience of our dataset. However, the protocol should also assist federal researchers in aggregating data about food security and community gardens. Users will also include local stakeholders: landholders, be they municipal, non-profit, or private; and land-users, community members who want to participate in community gardens or are doing research on a potential community.

Our protocol will need to consider aspects of space, time, and governance. A description of the physical space including lot size. latitude, longitude. When gardens came into existence and how they have changed. Both community gardens and food security metrics are subject to the landâ€™s governance be it by a local, state, federal, private, or public entity.

## User Stories

Through the utilization of User Stories we are able to more clearly define the needs and requirements for the Digging In protocol. The conceptualization of user needs early on allows Digging In to be user-focused and shows commitment to facilitating a holistic data landscape.
