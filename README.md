# Introduction

Digging In is a data repository that houses community garden data for use and reuse by policy makers, researchers, and the public. Originally born out of the interest of localizing data on food insecurity, Digging In found that community garden data specifically needed a centralized home and some large-scale normalization for use.

Throughout this protocol we will define policies and necessary formats in order to facilitate discovery and access, reuse for varying disciplines and data seekers, and outline the next steps needed to bring Digging In from concept to creation.

All files, including the information available in this GitBook, are also available in our[ GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/buechlersm/Digging-In-Community-Garden-Data)
