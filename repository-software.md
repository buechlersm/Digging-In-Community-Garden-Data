As determined through our [User Stories](https://lis598j-buechlerhammerquist.gitbook.io/digging-in-community-garden-data/user-community) - Digging In and its data will need to be hosted by a repository that can accept contributive datasets from community garden owners/managers, host and display geolocation information of community gardens, and ingest and display [metadata following DCAT schema.](https://lis598j-buechlerhammerquist.gitbook.io/digging-in-community-garden-data/metadata)

Based on these needs, an instance of CKAN would be sought after for implementation. Main reasons for using CKAN include: geospatial and visualization capabilities, is interoperable with other types of repositories, has frequent updates ensuring preservation, and community contributions to utilization of the instance is widely available. CKANâ€™s vocabularies and tags will allow for controlled access points as well as develop a user-drive folksonomy. These indexing tools will be primarily used for types of food produced and types of tools available.
